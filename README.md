## Support Engineer Tool (S.E.T.)

A tool intended to save Support engineers valuable time on tasks which, while not difficult, are time consuming. This is a project in collaboration with Juan Estrella, and is intended as a learning excercise with the goal of producing a powerful, safe, tool for day-to-day tasks.
